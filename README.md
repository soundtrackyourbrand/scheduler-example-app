# Soundtrack Scheduler

The Soundtrack Scheduler app lets you manage _Events_ that will assign music to one or many _Zones_ using the Soundtrack API.

## Gettings started

- Install dependencies `npm install`, `yarn install` or `pnpm install` (this documentation will use `pnpm` for the following examples)
- Start a database of choice that is supported by [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/). See more in the [Database setup](#database-setup) instructions.
- Configure your `.env` file. The `.env.sample` file contains the neccessary fields to make requests to the Soundtrack API. See more in [Soundtrack API configuration](#soundtrack-api-configuration).
- Start the app with `SYNC_DB=true pnpm dev`. If all goes well the app is running on [localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).
  - _Note: `SYNC_DB=true` will flush and re-create your database, only use it the first time you start the app or after changes to the database schema._

## Development

This project is based on [Remix.run](https://remix.run/), a full stack web framework that allows us to serve both a React app and server endpoints easily.

### Project setup

The app is split up in mainly two parts:

1. The Remix UI, routes and React components (located in `./app`)
1. The server that serves both the Remix app and the API endpoints (located in `./server.ts`)
1. The worker that checks what events needs to be acted upon and calls the Soundtrack API.

### UI components

This project uses [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) for UI components. To add a new component to the project run `pnpm shadcn add <component name>`.

New components are added to `app/components/ui/<components name>.tsx` and can be referenced as `~/components/ui/<component name>.tsx` in other parts of the app.

### Client data fetching

This project uses [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/) for data fetching.

## Database setup

You are required to provide your own database to be able to manage _Events_. We are using the [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/) ORM which comes with full support for Oracle, Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite and SQL Server, and more.

To get up and running quickly `sqlite` is installed and will create `db.sqlite` when the app starts.

To configure your database, edit `./lib/db/index.ts`.

## Soundtrack API configuration

In order to make requests to the Soundtrack API you will need to provide the app with an [API token](https://api.soundtrackyourbrand.com/v2/docs#requirements), or use [User authentication](https://api.soundtrackyourbrand.com/v2/docs#authorizing-as-a-user). The API will only let you see and take actions on the accounts and zones that you have access to as an API client or Soundtrack user.

The `.env.sample` file contains the required fields to make requests to the Soundtrack API.

```shell
cp .env.sample .env
# Add your token to the .env file
```

## Deployment

### Security

This app does not enforce any authentication, **do not put this app on the internet**.

### Building

The app contains two moving parts as described in [Project setup](#project-setup): the user facing React app and the server. These two needs to be built separately. To produce JavaScript files that can be run with plain `node` you can run the follwing two scrips defined in `package.json`.

- `pnpm build:remix` Builds the React app and puts the final output in `./build`.
- `pnpm build:server` Builds the server and puts it in `./build-server`. This step depends on the `pnpm build:remix` step.

After successfully running the commands above the app can be started with

```shell
node ./build-server/server.js
```

### App container

Every running environment is different, but to help getting this app deployed `./example.Dockerfile` will produce an image that runs the app.

```shell
$ docker build -t localhost/soundtrack-scheduler:dev -f example.Dockerfile .
...
Successfully tagged localhost/soundtrack-scheduler:dev
$ docker run -p 5173:5173 -v $(pwd)/.env:/app/.env --env "SYNC_DB=true" -it localhost/soundtrack-scheduler:dev
```
